Congratulations! You have finished the lesson on React components.

    Here’s a short recap of the concepts introduced in this lesson:

Function components can return multiple JSX lines by nesting the elements in a parent element.
Variable attributes can be used inside of a React component with JavaScript injections.
React components support logic by putting the logic statements above the return statements.
Components can conditionally return JSX elements by putting conditional statements inside of the components.
Components can respond to events by defining event handlers and passing them to the JSX elements.
Great job on tackling these complex topics! You have spent a lot of time studying React components in isolation! Now, it’s time to learn how components fit into the world around them.

    Instructions
If you would like to practice your learned skills, consider these challenges:

Add logic to the MyQuote component to produce different quotes based on different conditions.
Add elements onto the screen that can respond to events such as clicking or hovering.Make sure to define event handlers for them within the component.
